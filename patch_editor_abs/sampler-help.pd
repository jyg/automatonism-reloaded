In 1shot mode the sampler needs a trigger signal at the TRIG input
to fire the sample.;

The files are located in ../samples/ and are named sample1.wav \, sample2.wav
\, sample3.wav etc. To change the samples you have to replace those
files with your own files \, while keeping the same name structure.
This might seem counter-intuitive but the advantage of this system
is that your files will alwyays be pointed to the right location and
you can move your project main folder anywhere and to different platforms
without losing your samples. If you want a sampler that can load files
from anywhere on your harddrive I suggest you try the excellent sampler
module made by Claude Barker. More info about that at: https://github.com/megalon/pd-AUTOMATONISM-sampler
