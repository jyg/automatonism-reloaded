#X text 25 56 The "SAMPLER" module can load 8 different .wav tracks. The files are located in ../samples/ and are named sample1.wav \, sample2.wav \, sample3.wav etc. To change the samples you have to replace those files with your own files \, while keeping the same name structure. This might seem counter-intuitive but the advantage of this system is that your files will alwyays be pointed to the right location and you can move your project main folder anywhere and to different platforms without losing your samples. If you want a sampler that can load files from anywhere on your harddrive use extra-sampler module instead.;
